I begin by initialising my website and start to generate the theme. I wanted to try and get both the style and font to match and feel like they are a good pair. I wanted to aim for a font similar to comic sans, but with more of a formation to the characters. I had found a found style that is called Courier new, which I had found whilst searching my PC for enabled fonts within the system files. I had liked the look of that text style and based the whole theme and font on that style. My backup for this font is Cambria, which is a more universal font type, which comes as standard on many PC's. This backup choice was just in-case users dont have that font style enabled or active on there computes.
I wanted to start with the style. I did what I usually do, enabled borders and began to construct the layout. Within this webpage though. I liked the look of the black and white contrast. I felt as though this fit the theme really well.
Initially I wanted to generate text on the canvas, whilst attempts to generate the text on the canvas, I noticed that the text was hard to read, blured and from this I realised that this would be to difficult for the user to read.
I originally wanted the main mini-game to flash and only display the places on the terrain on which the irregularities are. But after realising how extensive the webpage flashes I realised this would be bad for some users with visual differences or epylepse.
I was originbally going to have the user only be able to use the scan once. But settled for more of a toggleable scan, so the user can preserve the scan and try and locate the items on the terrain. I also realised that I could make the user be able to obtain items from the terrain even if user had selected the wrong location. The items returned would be not as valuable, but still rewards the player. This reward has got a level of increase depending how well they do during the mini-games.
