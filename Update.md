I begin by initialising my website and start to generate the theme. I wanted to try and get both the style and font to match and feel like they are a good pair. I wanted to aim for a font similar to comic sans, but with more of a formation to the characters. I had found a found style that is called Courier new, which I had found whilst searching my PC for enabled fonts within the system files. I had liked the look of that text style and based the whole theme and font on that style. My backup for this font is Cambria, which is a more universal font type, which comes as standard on many PC's. This backup choice was just in-case users dont have that font style enabled or active on there computes.
I wanted to start with the style. I did what I usually do, enabled borders and began to construct the layout. Within this webpage though. I liked the look of the black and white contrast. I felt as though this fit the theme really well.
Initially I wanted to generate text on the canvas, whilst attempts to generate the text on the canvas, I noticed that the text was hard to read, blured and from this I realised that this would be to difficult for the user to read.
I originally wanted the main mini-game to flash and only display the places on the terrain on which the irregularities are. But after realising how extensive the webpage flashes I realised this would be bad for some users with visual differences or epylepse.
I was originbally going to have the user only be able to use the scan once. But settled for more of a toggleable scan, so the user can preserve the scan and try and locate the items on the terrain. I also realised that I could make the user be able to obtain items from the terrain even if user had selected the wrong location. The items returned would be not as valuable, but still rewards the player. This reward has got a level of increase depending how well they do during the mini-games.
There was some issues with create a map renderer, but the way on which I am rendering the map I am unable to make the function modular, originally I wanted to make the renderer module so that you can move around the map. I removed this feature because I felt like this would interfere with the mini-games mechanics, and also interfere with the function of the scan. I wanted to try and simplify the mini-game so that I can implement several other features along side of this. Recently I want to create and add a function on which the user can scan several times but what happens is the scan is able to do a 2 second burst. You may save some of the scan for another instance but the scan recovers over time. Also I want to work with this mini-game a little more to create another game like a quick-time event. I want to make the user create a series of dig attemps and once you have placed all your dig attempts. The game will begin another quick time event. During this event a sequence of QE will be displayed for a certain amount of time. Once this sequence stops being displayed, the user must resight it. If they have selected the correct location they will be rewarded with custom items. Depending on how well they complete the mini-game where they attempt to dig. If they incorrectly repeat the sequence they wil be rewarded with a broken, cracked or damaged varient to the items that they would have dug up.
I have changed a series of the variables and values, I am trying to make the game really fair but then the game would become more difficult and harder to play as it progresses.
