<h2>Interactive Website Development</h2><hr>
This is the readme.md file for my website that has been created for the interactive website development module. This game that I have created is to try and use my knowledge of JS, CSS and HTML to create a simple but yet effective series of mememory games. My idea was to create a game that contained a way of rewarding the player no matter what, but there reward value would improve depending on how well they complete each of the mini-games.

<h3 id="1">Introduction</h3><hr>
Initially I wanted to create a game on which would present the user with a series of different memory games, I didn't want to create a simple game with one mechanic and only be able to test the player in one way. I also wanted to try and create the game using only JS, CSS and HTML. I wanted to try and keep the website on which holds the game simple and yet effective so that it maybe able to be resized and changed depending on what the user would like to do. The functionality and simplisity of the two webpages make them very versatile.

I wanted to create a game that had the ability to inform the player on how to complete the different mini-games but, I had realised that text when created on a canvas can behave in a series of strange and interesting ways to. I chose to go back to my original idea and use an external text box for the Guide to use to talk to the player.

Originally I had wanted to make the game, all in one and try and create a series of assets by hand, but I liked the idea of a website that generates and creates the visuals using the canvas.getContect command and the 2D rendering graphics. I also wanted to try and create a series of functions within my game that can be changed massively, which would allow for functions like the world gen, to be able to create a series of worlds depending on the users choice.

One of the current things I am trying to create and implements is for some visual things to be geneerated on the canvas whilst the player is in the menu screen. Originally I wanted to hide the canvas and display it when the user would like to play a game that required visuals. Due to the issues that where created from hiding the canvas, I choice to leave the canvas always visible and will fill the empty space with some idle imagery. I want to make sure that the mini-games are on a higher priority than the actual extra content. Like producing some sort of visual fill-in. This is a feature that could help with stimulating the users attention but I prefer to make sure that the games work to the extent on which I want, before doing the extra content.

My idea was to create a game on which the user can be rewarded from. In this game depending on how well the user completes a sequence of mini-games. Dependings on how well they are rewarded. If they incorrectly place a marker in the wrong location they would be rewarded with biome-dependent items like stone, dirt, sand and wood. If they are to complete the minigames to a good standard they would be able to recieve better products. The idea was to have the items presented to the user in a museum when completed. But I thought of create another mini-game in there where you can recover the items you find. Once recovered they would be stored in the museum as a record of how the user has done and how well they have managed to compelte the mini-game sequence. Some form of scoring system will be placed on each item. Maybe a percentage of how well the item is, will be the way it is presented. This would be a mean of how well the user has done during the different mini-games.

<h3 id="2">Initial Idea</h3><hr>
My initial idea was to try and create a game that had some form of terrain, which would be generated randomly. This would mean that the functions to call out terrain genration and rendering would have to be versatile. I would then be able to create the different biomes within the game. Originally, I wanted to make the difficulty increase over time, but instead I want to make the game become more difficult when the user successfully completes a full mini-game. I may create an average of how well the user performs and from these statistics make the game demanding on the user but custom to how well they can complete the mini-games. I want to make the game able to become hard but not impossible. I want to try and present the user with a challenge that is equal to how well they can compelte the game.

The way on which the game would judge difficulty is through how accurate and how quick the user is. I will use the percentage of how accurate the user is to give them bonus time on the scan. This would be to allow the user to have bonus time if they are very inaccurate but if they succeed with the 2 second scan time I may decrease it. Then also I will try and create some form of time boundaries for the user. If they are quick or slow then create an understanding of how fast they are. Maybe creating a mean value of the users time they take and how accurate they are overal.

I am trying to implement a function on which the user is able to select any location and after selecting the amount of locations given to the user, then I would begin a second mini-game this would a quick timed, sequence event. I will try and make the text command produce a sequence that the user will have to repeat. This type of mini-game will be used twice. One within this instance and another when the user is in the museum trying to recover an item that they have unearthed.
