<h2>Interactive Website Development</h2><hr>
This is the readme.md file for my website that has been created for the interactive website development module. This game that I have created is to try and use my knowledge of JS, CSS and HTML to create a simple but yet effective series of mememory games. My idea was to create a game that contained a way of rewarding the player no matter what, but there reward value would improve depending on how well they complete each of the mini-games.

<h3 id="1">Introduction</h3><hr>
Initially I wanted to create a game on which would present the user with a series of different memory games, I didn't want to create a simple game with one mechanic and only be able to test the player in one way. I also wanted to try and create the game using only JS, CSS and HTML. I wanted to try and keep the website on which holds the game simple and yet effective so that it maybe able to be resized and changed depending on what the user would like to do. The functionality and simplisity of the two webpages make them very versatile.

I wanted to create a game that had the ability to inform the player on how to complete the different mini-games but, I had realised that text when created on a canvas can behave in a series of strange and interesting ways to. I chose to go back to my original idea and use an external text box for the Guide to use to talk to the player.

Originally I had wanted to make the game, all in one and try and create a series of assets by hand, but I liked the idea of a website that generates and creates the visuals using the canvas.getContect command and the 2D rendering graphics. I also wanted to try and create a series of functions within my game that can be changed massively, which would allow for functions like the world gen, to be able to create a series of worlds depending on the users choice.

One of the current things I am trying to create and implements is for some visual things to be geneerated on the canvas whilst the player is in the menu screen. Originally I wanted to hide the canvas and display it when the user would like to play a game that required visuals. Due to the issues that where created from hiding the canvas, I choice to leave the canvas always visible and will fill the empty space with some idle imagery.
